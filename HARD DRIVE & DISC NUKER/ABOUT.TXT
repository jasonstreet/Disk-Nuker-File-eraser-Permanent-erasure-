 Darik's Boot and Nuke: About
 ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

 Darik's Boot and Nuke ("DBAN") is a self-contained boot floppy that securely
 wipes the hard disks of most computers. DBAN will automatically and completely
 delete the contents of any hard disk that it can detect, which makes it an
 appropriate utility for bulk or emergency data destruction.

 This program clears directly attached IDE, PATA, SATA, SCSI, and SAS disks. 
 Some USB and IEEE 1394 (Firewire) devices may be recognized.  DBAN requires a
 computer with a PCI bus and 32 megabytes of memory.

 All DBAN components are subject to copyright and are licensed; many by the
 GPL and similar FLOSS licenses. Review the source code for more information.
